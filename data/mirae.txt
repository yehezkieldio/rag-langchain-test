- Assignment of required training modules or a buddy system for support.
- Follow-up by HR and managers within the first week and month to ensure successful integration.

## Expense Reimbursement

MIRAE standardizes the process for employees to claim business-related expenses, ensuring transparency and timely reimbursement:

- Employees incur approved business expenses and retain original receipts.
- A digital expense report is completed and submitted via the internal system.
- All supporting documentation is scanned and attached to the report.
- The report is submitted to the designated manager for review and approval.
- Approved reports are processed by the Finance department, with reimbursements made via direct deposit within 5-7 business days.
- Expense reports must be submitted within 30 days of the expense date.

## Physical Access Control

MIRAE maintains strict physical access control to protect its facilities and personnel:

- Employees are issued access badges upon hire and must wear them at all times within the facility.
- Visitors are required to sign in at reception, present valid identification, and be escorted by a MIRAE employee.
